# 10 GHz LNA — KiCad 8 Project

This project contains the schematic and layout for a low-noise amplifier designed for 10 GHz amateur radio applications. It uses a packaged pHEMT MMIC, SMA connectors, and Rogers 4003C substrate.

## Features
- MMIC-based gain stage
- Biasing network with gate protection
- RF input/output with SMA pads
- Designed for low noise figure and stable gain
